# ☀️ Summer of SQL

Welcome to the Summer of SQL Challenge for 2024!

This summer, amidst the scorching British heat, I'm dedicating my weekends to sharpening my SQL skills as a Data Analyst. Expect to find me in cafes around Reading, enjoying the air conditioning while fervently coding SQL queries.

I’m tackling this challenge using [DBFiddle](https://www.db-fiddle.com/), an online SQL playground with PostgreSQLv15, to solve various SQL problems.

Feel free to check out my solutions and reach out to me on LinkedIn if you have any questions. Just a note—there are often multiple ways to approach a problem, different interpretations of questions, and variations in SQL dialects (e.g., MySQL vs PostgreSQL). If your solution differs, that’s perfectly fine!

The key is to understand and explain the reasoning behind your SQL code.

Share your progress on social media with #SummerofSQL and #datafam.

This challenge was thoughtfully created by [Will Sutton](https://github.com/wjsutton), who has done an excellent job in curating this repository.
