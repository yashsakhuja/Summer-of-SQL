# Summer-of-SQL

Welcome to The Summer of SQL!

It's Summer of '24 and indeed a very hot British Summer. This summer, I have decided to take on this challenge to polish my SQL skills which need to be on top.





Please note, there are sometimes:

multiple ways to solve a question,
different was of interpreting a question,
and variations in SQL dialects (e.g. mySQL vs PostgreSQL)
Your answer may be different and that's ok!

If you can explain why you have written the code to answer the question that is the most important thing.

Share your progress on social media using the hashtags #SummerofSQL and #datafam.
