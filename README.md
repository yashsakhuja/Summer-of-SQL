# ☀️ Summer-of-SQL

Welcome to The Summer of SQL!

It's Summer of '24 and indeed a very hot British Summer. This summer, I have decided to take on this challenge to polish my SQL skills which need to be on top as a Data Analyst.

Hence, every other weekend you could see me sitting in cafes around Reading (for the aircon) coding SQL logics aggresively banging keys of my keyboard.

All my SQL code is written on [DBFiddle](https://www.db-fiddle.com/) - an online SQL playground using the PostgreSQLv15

Here's my solution to the Summer of SQL Challenge, if you have any questions on my solutions, Please feel free to connect with me on Linkedin and drop me a message

However, Please note, there are sometimes:

multiple ways to solve a question,
different was of interpreting a question,
and variations in SQL dialects (e.g. mySQL vs PostgreSQL)
Your answer may be different and that's ok!

If you can explain why you have written the code to answer the question that is the most important thing.

Share your progress on social media using the hashtags #SummerofSQL and #datafam.

This challenge was crafted by [Will Sutton](https://github.com/wjsutton) who has done an amazing job in building this repository.
